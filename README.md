Mad Zoo is an interactive web application designed to provide users with a fun and educational experience exploring a virtual zoo. Visitors can navigate through various animal sections, view detailed information about different species, and enjoy a visually appealing and responsive interface. The application is developed collaboratively using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, allowing multiple contributors to add and manage animal content.

Features

Home Page: Displays an overview of the zoo and a marquee of featured animals.

Animal Sections: Separate pages for Cats, Dogs, Birds, and Snakes, including images and descriptions.

Collaborator Content: Supports multiple contributors with their own animal pages (e.g., Jason’s Zoo).

Responsive Design: Fully responsive layout for desktop and mobile devices.

Navigation: Easy navigation between sections and a “Back to Top” feature.

Interactive Elements: Animations such as moving animal images and interactive links.
