      <h3 class="description">
        Bald eagles are amazing birds that live mostly in North America, near lakes, rivers, and coasts. 
        They have bright white heads, brown bodies, and super sharp eyes that let them see fish from very far away. 
        Bald eagles are strong and powerful flyers. 
        They glide gracefully in the sky or dive fast to catch their favorite food, fish, with their big sharp talons. 
        They build enormous nests called eyries, sometimes as big as a small car, and often reuse the same nest every year, adding new sticks each season. 
        Bald eagles usually mate for life, and both parents take care of the eggs and babies until they are ready to fly. 
        Even though they look fierce, bald eagles are careful and protective of their family. 
        They are also the national symbol of the United States, which makes them extra special and respected by people everywhere.
