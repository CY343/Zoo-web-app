      <h3 class="description">
        Vultures are big birds that eat mostly dead animals, which makes them important for keeping nature clean. 
        They have bald heads, which helps them stay clean when eating, and very strong stomachs that can handle all kinds of germs. 
        Vultures can soar really high in the sky for hours without flapping their wings, using warm air currents to glide. 
        They have sharp eyesight to spot food from far away, and they usually feed in groups. 
        Even though some people think they are scary, vultures are really helpful to the environment. 
        Watching them fly is cool because they look like they are floating in the sky without effort.
