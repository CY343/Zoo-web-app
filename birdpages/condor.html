      <h3 class="description">
        Condors are huge birds with really long wings, and they are known for gliding through the sky without flapping much.
         They mostly eat dead animals, which helps keep the environment clean. 
         Condors have a bald head, which is kind of funny, but it helps them stay clean while eating. 
         These birds can live a very long time, sometimes over 50 years, and they usually stay in the same area their whole life.
          Condors are super strong flyers, and they can soar for hours without getting tired. 
          Seeing a condor spread its wings is amazing because they look so big and powerful in the sky.
